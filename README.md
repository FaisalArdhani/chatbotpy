![Chatbot](chatbot.jpg)

**Assistant GPT-3.5** is a simple chatbot built using Python that can interact with users through the terminal. The chatbot provides responses to various user inputs and can engage in basic conversation. It uses a dictionary-based response system to generate replies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a copy of this chatbot up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FaisalArdhani/chatbotpy.git
cd chatbotpy
```

2. Run the chatbot:

```bash
python bot.py
```

## üí¨ How to Use

- Upon running the chatbot, you'll see a colored chat prompt with the name "Assistant GPT-3.5".
- Type your messages to interact with the chatbot. Try saying "hello", "what's your name?", "how are you?", or "exit" to quit the conversation.
- The chatbot will respond to your messages with pre-defined responses.

## üé® Customization

You can easily customize the chatbot responses or add more responses by modifying the `chatbot_response` function in the script.

```python
def chatbot_response(user_input):
    # Custom responses go here
    responses = {
        "custom input": "Custom output",
        # Add more custom responses as needed
    }
    return responses.get(user_input.lower(), "Sorry, I don't understand your question.")
```

## üåà Colorful Chat

The chat messages have different colors to make the conversation more fun and visually appealing. The `colored_print` function in the script is responsible for applying colors to the chat messages.

```python
def colored_print(text, color):
    colors = {
        'red': '\033[91m',
        'green': '\033[92m',
        'yellow': '\033[93m',
        'blue': '\033[94m',
        'magenta': '\033[95m',
        'cyan': '\033[96m',
        'white': '\033[97m',
        'reset': '\033[0m'
    }
    return f"{colors[color]}{text}{colors['reset']}"
```

Feel free to modify the colors or add more colors to suit your taste!
